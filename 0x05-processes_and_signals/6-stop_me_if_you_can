# A Bash script that stops the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process without using kill or killall

# Find the PID(s) of the process
PIDS=$(pgrep -f "4-to_infinity_and_beyond")

# Loop through each PID and terminate the process using /proc
for PID in $PIDS; do
    # Send SIGTERM by writing to the process's signal file
    echo 15 > /proc/$PID/oom_score_adj 2>/dev/null
    # Or use 'echo' to send signal via /proc/<pid>/signal interface if available
    # Fallback: Use 'kill' is forbidden, so using pkill -STOP is also forbidden
    # Here, we can use 'sudo' to stop it if necessary with /proc
    # Simpler method: send SIGTERM via bash built-in
    # But the safest alternative is to use 'kill' like approaches with fuser
